Portfolio Project Non-Technical Write Up – E Kenny
This Portfolio Project attempts to create a Machine Learning Model using K Nearest Neighbors to identify/predict which patients will develop heart disease. A practical application of such a solution would enable health practitioners to identify at risk patients earlier, when treatment (and possibly prevention) will be most effective. A possible User Story  might be: ‘As a health care professional, I want to identify at the earliest possible time my patients who are most likely to develop heart disease so that I can recommend preventative measures and treatments when they can have the greatest positive impact.’
As this objective represents a binary classification (heart disease and no heart disease) I chose K Nearest Neighbors with Euclidean distance and k value of 5 to build a model.
The dataset I used came from Kaggle with a very high usability rating of 10.0.
